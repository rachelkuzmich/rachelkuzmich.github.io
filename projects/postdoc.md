In August 2025, I joined the Faculty of Environmental Sciences and Natural Resource Management at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences as a postdoctoral researcher within the [PREDICT project](https://www.nmbu.no/en/research/projects/predict). This project is led by Line Nybakken, and includes contributions from Danielle Creek, Johan Asplund, Attila Nemes, Hans Ole Ã˜rka and Terje Gobakken. My research within this project is focused on forest ecosystem monitoring with remote sensing in the context of climate change.
