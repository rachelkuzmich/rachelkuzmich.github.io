Welcome to my projects page. Here you can begin exploring my PhD and postdoctoral research, teaching experience, and a list of publications (including posters, presentations, and public talks). Together, these projects reflect my interest in understanding the drivers, patterns and impacts of forest change across scales, space, and time with remote sensing.
