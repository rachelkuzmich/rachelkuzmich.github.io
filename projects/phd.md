My PhD explored how a time series of airborne laser scanning (ALS) structural and Landsat spectral metrics can be used to understand bird habitat, occurrence, and niche across multiple UK woodlands. My work focused on four species with different habitat preferences across my study sites: the generalists Blue Tit and Chaffinch, and the specialists Chiffchaff and Willow Warbler.

In my first chapter, I characterized woodland vegetation structure using ALS and developed species distribution models and habitat suitability indices. Generalist species were widespread, while specialists were more restricted and sensitive to forest structure. My second chapter  evaluated how fusing ALS and Landsat data at pixel and object levels affected predictions of forest structure and species occurrence. ALS data generally provided the most accurate predictions for specialist species, while generalists were well captured by Landsat. Finally, I examined whether speciesâ€™ ecological niches were conserved or diverged across successional stages in my third chapter. Most species showed niche conservatism, though Chiffchaff displayed some niche expansion and flexibility.

Overall, this research demonstrates that remote sensing time series capture ecologically meaningful habitat attributes and provide valuable insights into bird ecology, while also offering guidance for modelling species occurrence and niche dynamics.
