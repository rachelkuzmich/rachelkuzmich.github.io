# About me

I am currently a postdoc in the Faculty of Environmental Sciences and Nature Management at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences. I completed my PhD in spring 2025 from Queen's University (Canada) under the supervision of Paul Treitz and Ross Hill (Bournemouth University, United Kingdom). My academic upbringing began at Trent University (Canada), where I completed a joint Honours BSc in biology and geography, with a minor in international development studies.
