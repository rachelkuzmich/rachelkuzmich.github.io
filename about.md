# About me

I am a postdoc in the Faculty of Environmental Sciences and Nature Management at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences. I completed my PhD at Queen's University (Canada) under the supervision of Paul Treitz and Ross Hill (Bournemouth University, United Kingdom). My academic upbringing began at Trent University (Canada), where I completed a joint Honours BSc in biology and geography, with a minor in international development studies.

My research is focused on forest dynamics - including drivers, patterns and impacts - using remote sensing and modeling approaches. My interests span from fundamental research and classic ecological questions, to practical applications in remote sensing, biodiversity and ecosystem monitoring. In this work, I strive to foster interdisciplinary collaboration, recognizing that our most pressing ecological and environmental challenges require multiple perspectives. As a first-generation student and woman in STEM, I am committed to making science open, accessible, and inclusive to all. To this end, I actively engage in science communication and promoting open science.
