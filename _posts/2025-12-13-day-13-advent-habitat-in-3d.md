excerpt: "Here’s what remote sensing can do for ecologists. Today’s focus is on how 3D habitat structure shapes ecological patterns."

Vertical complexity, gaps, layering, and understory density strongly influence species distributions, interactions, and biodiversity. For years, this 3D structure was difficult to measure beyond small plots and commonly available remote sensing data simplified the complexity of habitat into 2D. Lidar and photogrammetry now provide detailed vertical profiles of vegetation, revealing how biomass and foliage are distributed from the ground to the canopy. These data allow ecologists to quantify 3D habitat complexity directly, rather than relying on coarse proxies like height from a DSM, as shown in this figure from [Moudrý et al 2023](https://doi.org/10.1111/ddi.13644).

This matters especially for taxa that occupy three-dimensional space. Many bird species, for example, partition habitat vertically. Some birds forage in the upper canopy, gleaning insects from the leaves, others in the understory, and others along edges or gaps. Similar vertical specialization exists for bats, insects, and other species, making structural information critical for understanding species occurrence and coexistence.

Structural metrics derived from remote sensing allow ecologists to ask new questions about how structure mediates species occurrence, co-existence, movement, and resource use. Commonly used variables include:
- Vertical foliage distribution and layering
- Canopy gaps and heterogeneity
- Understory density and openness

Three-dimensional habitat structure may explain occurrence patterns better than information derived from spectral data, like tree species composition. By capturing how space is organized in 3D, as species experience the world, remote sensing provides a link between habitat structure and use, improving our understanding species–environment relationships.
